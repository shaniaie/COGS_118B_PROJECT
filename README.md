# Identifying the Severity of a Heart Disease

## Summary:
Studies show that heart disease is the ruling cause of death for both men and women in the United States.
Using the Heart Disease Dataset retrieved from the
UCI Machine Learning Repository, we explored whether
specific attributes (age, trestbps, chol, thalch, oldpeak)
show signs that the patient has heart disease. To analyze
this, we used the algorithms, K-means and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) along with factoring in
pre-PCA and post-PCA.
